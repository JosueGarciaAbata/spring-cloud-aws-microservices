## 📘 Project Description

This project is designed to strengthen and consolidate core concepts of modern backend development using the Spring ecosystem.  
Throughout the modules in this repository, different technologies and patterns are applied in order to build scalable, flexible, and production-ready microservices.

### 🚀 Concepts and Technologies Covered

- **Spring Boot** – Rapid application development with auto-configuration and opinionated defaults
- **Spring IoC (Inversion of Control)** – Dependency injection to write cleaner, more decoupled code
- **Spring Data JPA & Hibernate** – Simplified database access through the JPA specification and ORM capabilities
- **RESTful API development** – Creating well-structured and stateless HTTP services
- **Spring Cloud** – Building distributed systems and microservice architectures
- **Eureka Netflix** – Service discovery and dynamic registration of microservices
- **WebClient & OpenFeign** – HTTP clients for inter-service communication
- **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer** – Client-side load balancing without relying on external tools
- **Resilience4j** – Implementing resilience patterns such as circuit breakers, retries, and rate limiting
- **Spring Cloud Gateway** – API gateway and routing layer for microservices
- **Spring Cloud Config Server** – Centralized configuration management across environments
- **Micrometer Tracing & Zipkin** – Distributed tracing and observability in microservices
- **Docker** – Containerizing applications for consistent deployment
- **Amazon AWS Deployment** – Deploying microservices to cloud infrastructure  
  *(previous projects targeted Microsoft Azure — this one focuses on AWS)*
